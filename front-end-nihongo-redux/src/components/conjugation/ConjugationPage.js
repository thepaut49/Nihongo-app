      <h2>Japanese Conjugation</h2>
      <p>
        In the Japanese language, the beginning of a word is usually preserved
        during conjugations (this is the &quot;verb stem&quot;), whilst the
        ending of the word is altered in some way to change the meaning (this is
        the &quot;inflectional suffix&quot;). Unlike other languages, Japanese
        verb conjugations are independent from a subject&apos;s perspective
        (such as the first/second/third person), gender (i.e.
        neutral/feminine/masculine) and plurality (e.g. &quot;they&quot;).
      </p>
      <span>
        All the verbs are divided into 3 groups that share the same endings :
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>Godan verbs</li>
        <li>Ichidan verbs</li>
        <li>
          Irregular verbs, most notably: する (suru, to do) and 来る (kuru, to
          come)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Verb groups</h3>
      <h4>Godan verbs</h4>
      <span>
        The basic form of Group 1 verbs end with &quot;~ u&quot;. This group is
        also called Consonant-stem verbs or Godan-doushi (Godan verbs).
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>hanasu （話す） - to speak</li>
        <li>kaku （書く） - to write</li>

        <li>nomu （飲む） - to drink</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Ichidan verbs</h4>
      <p>
        The basic form of Group 2 verbs end with either &quot;~iru&quot; or
        &quot;~ eru&quot;. This group is also called Vowel-stem-verbs or
        Ichidan-doushi (Ichidan verbs).
      </p>

        they end with &quot;~ iru&quot; or &quot;~ eru&quot;.
      </span>

      </ul>
      <h4>Irregular verbs</h4>
      <span>
        There are only two irregular verbs, kuru (to come) and suru (to do). The
        verb &quot;suru&quot; is probably the most often used verb in Japanese.
        It is used as &quot;to do,&quot; &quot;to make,&quot; or &quot;to
        cost.&quot; It is also combined with many nouns (of Chinese or Western
        origin) to make them into verbs. Here are some examples.
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>benkyousuru （勉強する） - to study</li>
        <li>ryokousuru （旅行する） - to travel</li>
        <li>yushutsusuru （輸出する） - to export</li>
        <li>dansusuru （ダンスする） - to dance</li>
        <li>shanpuusuru （シャンプーする） - to shampoo</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tenses</h3>
      <span>For each tense there are 4 different form :</span>
      <ul>
        <li>plain </li>
        <li>plain negative</li>
        <li>polite </li>
        <li>polite negative</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>PRESENT, FUTUR</h4>
      <p>The present tense is used for future and habitual action as well.</p>
      <h4>〜た PAST</h4>
      <p>
        The past tense is used to express actions completed in the past (I saw,
        I bought etc.) and present perfect tense (I have read, I have done
        etc.).
      </p>
      <h4>て FORM</h4>
      <p>The て form is necessary for making polite requests.</p>
      <h4>IMPERATIVE</h4>
      <p>
        The imperative form functions as firm instructions do in English.
        It&apos;s used to give orders to subordinates (such as within military
        ranks, or towards pet animals) and to give direct instructions within
        intimate relationships (for example, within family or close friends).
        When directed towards a collective rather than an individual, the
        imperative form is used for mandatory action or motivational speech. The
        imperative form is also used in reported speech.
      </p>
      <h4>〜させる CAUSATIVE</h4>
      <p>
        The causative form (使役形, shiekikei) is used to express that a subject
        was forced or allowed to do something
      </p>
      <h4>〜ば CONDITIONAL</h4>
      <p>
        The conditional form (also known as the &quot;hypothetical form&quot;,
        &quot;provisional form&quot; and the &quot;provisional conditional eba
        form&quot;) is broadly equivalent to the English conditionals
        &quot;if…&quot; or &quot;when…&quot;. It describes a condition that
        provides a specific result, with emphasis on the condition. The
        conditional form is used to describe hypothetical scenarios or general
        truths.
      </p>
      <h4>〜れる POTENTIAL</h4>
      <p>
        The potential form describes the capability of doing something. It is
        also used to ask favors from others, just as &quot;Can you…?&quot; does
        in English. However, unlike in English, the potential form does not
        request permission; the phrase この林檎が食べられる？ (kono ringo ga
        taberareru?, &quot;Can I eat this apple?&quot; ) is always understood to
        mean &quot;Do I have the ability to eat this apple?&quot; or &quot;Is
        this apple edible?&quot; (but never &quot;May I eat this apple?&quot; ).
      </p>
      <h4>〜られる PASSIVE</h4>
      <p>
        The passive form (受身形, ukemikei) refocuses the verb as the target
        objective of a sentence; it emphasizes the action as the detail of
        importance. Although a sentence can include a specific subject enacting
        the passive verb, the subject is not required. The passive voice can
        nuance neutrality, a regrettable action (suffering passive) or a means
        of being respectful.
      </p>
      <h4>〜よう VOLITIONAL</h4>
      <p>
        The volitional form (also known as the &quot;conjectural form&quot;,
        &quot;tentative form&quot;, &quot;presumptive form&quot; and the
        &quot;hortative form&quot;) is used to express speaker&apos;s will or
        intention (volitional), make an inclusive command or invitation
        (hortative or persuasive) or to make a guess or supposition
        (presumptive).
      </p>
      <h4>〜なさい POLITE COMMAND</h4>
      <h4>〜やすい EASY TO</h4>
      <h4>〜にくい HARD TO</h4>
      <h4>〜ている PRESENT PROGRESSIVE</h4>
      <h4>〜そう LOOKS LIKE</h4>
      <h4>〜たい DESIRE</h4>
      <h4>〜たがる WANTS TO</h4>
      <h4>〜ながら SIMULTANEOUS</h4>
